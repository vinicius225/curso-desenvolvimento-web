        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply 
        random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin 
        literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
         McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in 
         Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, 
         consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through 
         the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered t
         he undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 
         1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
         (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 
         BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very 
         popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem 
         Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line
          in section 1.10.32.
